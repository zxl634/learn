# Setting up the showcases repo reproducibly

## Makefile
My first goal is to set up a the project and documenting every step of the way.

Of course, it is redundant when it is possible to simply to clone the repository, but for the sake of documenting everything, I have decided also to document how the project is set up.

Thus, I make a Makefile. The first target in the Makefile is `create-dirs`, which does what it promises, namely creating the directories that this project is going to use.

## git
The next step is to add the repo to Github to https://github.com/zxl634/showcases.

I make the first commit, change `master` to `main` (`git branch -M main`) and add the remote (`git remote add origin https://github.com/zxl634/showcases.git`).

## README
Next up, I create a README for the base of the repo to tell people about the purpose of the whole project.

## Next post
[Next post](2.md) will be about the possibility to include code from another file in these markdown files, so that I don't repeat myself unnecessarily. Specifically, I'll try to include the title from the markdown file in the [README.md](README.md), which serves as a kind of index.

I'll try to alway create the task for tomorrow before finishing up today's.
