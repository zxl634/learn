# Setting up the showcases repo reproducibly

My first goal is to set up a the project and documenting every stop of the way.

Of course, it is redundant when it is possible to simply to clone the repository, but for the sake of documenting everything, I have decided also to document how the project is set up.

Thus, I make a Makefile. The first target in the Makefile is `create-dirs`, which does what it promises.

The next step is to add the repo to Github to https://github.com/zxl634/showcases.
