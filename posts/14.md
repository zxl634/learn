# Debugging

Having read that "Sprinkling printf statements is an efficient debugging technique." on the list of [Falsehoods CS Students (Still) Believe Upon Graduating](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/cs-falsehoods.html) struck a chord with me as I had just been doing that extensively for a feature I was trying to test and debug.

Being a self-taught programmer I'm very sensitive when I encounter things like this, so I wanted to find out what to do instead.

First I read this [Q/A](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/225243/is-printing-to-console-stdout-a-good-debugging-strategy) on StackExchange that advises to use a combination of debuggers and logging/print statements. The ideas presented about the advantages of using a logging framework instead of simply printing information made sense to me. Especially the part of not needing to clean up the code subsequently as this is something I have had to do a lot previously (only to reinstate the print statements when a new or similar bug turned up).

I was, however, comforted when I found the view that "logging" is just a fancy name printing data to some other stream than the default stream.[1]

I'm totally on board with the idea of logging, but there is a cost associated with it in terms of added overhead. I'm however convinced that this cost is worth it in almost all instances.
