# Setup a Django project reproducibly

The goal of this post is to setup a Django project in a Docker container ([code](../python/django/1/)) following the guide here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/

I start by creating a Django project with `django-admin startproject mysite`.[1]

Creating a [Dockerfile](../python/django/1/Dockerfile), [docker-compose.yml](../python/django/1/docker-compose.yml), [requirements.txt](../python/django/1/requirements.txt) and running `sudo docker-compose run web django-admin startproject composeexample .` (have created a target `docker-compose-initial` in a [Makefile](../python/django/1/Makefile) with this). Had to change version number in docker-compose.yml to 3.3 (see [here](9.md)).

Adding the correct database information in [settings.py](../python/django/1/mysite/settings.py) so that it corresponds with the entries in [docker-compose.yml](../python/django/1/docker-compose.yml) and running `docker-compose up`.
