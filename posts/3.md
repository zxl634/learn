# Setup a Django project reproducibly

The goal of this post is to setup a Django project in a Docker container.

https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/

Creating a [Dockerfile](), [docker-compose.yml](), [requirements.txt]() and running `$ sudo docker-compose run web django-admin startproject composeexample .` Had to change version number in docker-compose.yml to 3.3 (see [here](9.md)).

Got the following error: `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/code/manage.py'`
