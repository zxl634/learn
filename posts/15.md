# Starting a process in the background in bash

I frequently have to start a number of processes on my computer for my development environment. For instance, I need:

1. two separate [django runserver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/django-admin/#runserver) (one with a newer version of python and django than the other, so runs in two virtual environments),
2. a [Webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) (we use something like [this](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/examples/api/simple/server.js)),
3. [a ClojureScript compiler](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs), 
4. some custom python scripts for getting serving content from [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/) that comes from [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/), and
5. some [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) apps invoked from the command line also.

Mostly I have have several terminal windows open with Vims `:terminal` command, but wanted also to find out how to run them all in the same terminal window in the background and then just redirecting the output to temporary log files I could consult if anything was wrong.

Reading [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8220098/how-to-redirect-the-output-of-an-application-in-background-to-dev-null) that I could simply use something of the form `yourcommand > /dev/null 2>&1 &` solved it for me.
